* Add UNILEVEL Feature to Database
    - Add referred_by to users table, its purpose is to identify who referred the user. ( DONE CREATING REFERAL )
* Redevelop Mobile API
    - Use the old source code as reference of the logic and use FastAPI with the provided project structure.
    - Develop based on the chronological order;
        -> Initiate Login # DONE I think hehe
        -> Process Login # this too DONE, but i think i did it in a wrong way
        -> Validate MPIN # DONE
        -> Set MPIN # DONE
        -> Reset MPIN # DONE

        -> Initiate Cash-OUT = Ask James after reveloping the MPIN Feature for TopWallet Staging Access
        -> Process Cash-OUT = Ask James after reveloping the MPIN Feature for TopWallet Staging Access
        -> Initiate PayQR = This will be discussed after developing the Process Cash-OUT
        -> Process PayQR = This will be discussed after developing the Process Cash-OUT





# INITIATE LOGIN
- get mobile_number
- user = UserRepo.get_user().filter(mobile_number)
- if not user.mpin:
    otpRepo.create_otp() -> user
    otpRepo.send_otp() -> user.mobile_number
    otpRepo.validate_otp() -> created otp (same, datetime)
    


# create otp record
- once the opt expired or used get the otp record and delete it 

# 

# TODO

- Validate MPIN wala yung data ng users na tulad ng nasa Flask  ( DONE )

- Process Login wala yung jwt sa response, eto yung gagamitin ng frontend to authenticate. Done

- Protect MPIN Endpoint with JWT Auth.  DONE

- Merchant and User, sa Membership API lang ito

- yung otp gamitin mo yung itexmo api para sa pagsend ng otp

para may overview ka ng responses ng Mobile API

1. Register to GoSEND

bali ang goal for Cash Out is:

√ P2P Transfer to Netsui Wallet

√ Initiate Self Withdraw from Netsui Wallet to User (Top Wallet)

√ Create transactions table record with pending status

    √ Create Withdraw reference record to user who initiated cash out
    √ Create Withdraw record to user who initiated cash out

    √ Create Commission record to 1st Level Referal (Who Referred the user initiated cash out)
    √ Create Commission record to 2nd Level Referal (Who Referred the 1st Level)
    √ Create Commission record to 3rd Level Referal (Who Referred the 2nd Level)

    √ Make sure that all records are pending. No need to send OTP, topwallet will handle the OTP.

√ Process Self Withdraw from Netsui Wallet to User
√ Perform the commission sending of points
    √ Update users, 1st, 2nd and 3rd level referral's wallet balance based on the commission set on the transactions table.


Make sure to copy yung format ng endpoint and json body

Ayan yung tinatawag na Unilevel yung Referral Commissions

Code read mo yung initiate_cash_out at process_cash_out sa Flask andun na lahat ng logic


User1 nirefer ni User2 = User2 is first level
User2 is nirefer ni User3 = User3 is second level
User3 is nirefer ni User4 = User4 is third level



Account creation > unilevel default = 0

If user(1) refer another user(2): user1 unilevel = 1 40pesos

if user(2) refer another user(3): user2 unilevel = 2 10pesos

if user(3) refer another user(4): user3 unilevel = 3 5pesos

if user(4) refer another user(5): user4 unilevel will be level 3 since its the max level

and so on, level 3 is max which is 5 pesos per refer
